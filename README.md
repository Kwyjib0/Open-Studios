# Open Studios

The concept of Open Studios came from a yearly event in New York where artists of all kinds opened their personal studios for all to enjoy, experience and witness. With this sense of community, comradery and support there was no need to navigate politics and contracts of a gallery or museum for an artist to be showcased.

Inspirit of this movement, Open Studios has gone digital !

[Llukkah](https://www.github.com/llukkah), [Lee Harvey](https://github.com/VirtDev337) and [Christopher Linton](https://github.com/Kwyjib0) is taking this opportunity to give artists found in all corners and crevices of the world a platform to have a voice and their vision a chance to be seen. This is the ideal platform for the artist that you haven't heard of... yet.
